# Agentic RAG Chatbot for Intelligent Document Processing

An intelligent, agent-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system purpose-built for document-heavy workflows. This project enables contextual question-answering over unstructured documents using agentic orchestration, advanced chunking, and production-grade vector retrieval.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project leverages modern GenAI tooling to build an **agentic RAG chatbot** optimized for PDF and text-based document ingestion. It simulates intelligent multi-step reasoning workflows using agents, providing grounded, traceable, and interactive responses.

Use cases include:
- Automated compliance document analysis
- Contract review assistants
- Financial research copilots
- Internal knowledge base assistants

---

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

- **Agentic Orchestration:** Powered by LangGraph to manage multi-step reasoning and task delegation.
- **Contextual Embedding:** Uses OpenAI for high-quality embedding of document chunks.
- **Custom Chunking:** Efficient handling of complex document structures (PDFs, large text blobs).
- **Scalable Vector Store:** Qdrant enables fast and accurate similarity search across large corpora.
- **RAG Architecture:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation ensures factual grounding from documents.
- **Conversational Interface:** Built for extensibility into chat-based frontends or APIs.
