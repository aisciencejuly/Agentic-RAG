When citizens elect delegates to represent them in the conduct of public education, their representatives have authority to exercise their best judgment in determining policies, making decisions, and approving procedures for fulfilling their responsibilities. All decisions made by the School Committee will be made with the primary goal of optimizing the learning of the children enrolled in our schools. (excerpt from Policy AB)",
